# Event Generation and Reconstruction with RUS

This module allows you to perform event generation and reconstruction using the **`Fun4AllSim.C`** macro. Similar to the [SimChainDev module](https://github.com/E1039-Collaboration/e1039-analysis/tree/master/SimChainDev), this script facilitates event simulation, but with an **additional feature**: support for the **RUS file manager** for input and output handling.

## Key Features
- Generate events using **`Fun4AllSim.C`**.
- Seamless integration with the **RUS file manager** for enhanced input/output management using either DimuAnaRUS (using SubsysReco) or using [Fun4AllVectFileManager](https://github.com/E1039-Collaboration/e1039-analysis/tree/master/Fun4AllVectFileManager).

When you want a large set of simulated events, you should run the simulation on the grid. The procedure is explained in this [Wiki page](https://github.com/E1039-Collaboration/e1039-wiki/wiki/Submit-jobs-to-the-grid).
